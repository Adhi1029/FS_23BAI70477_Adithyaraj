EXPERIMENT 1

Modern Frontend Frameworks and SPA Development

Objectives
	1.	Understand modern frontend frameworks and SPA architecture
	2.	Set up development environment with Node.js and npm
	3.	Create a functional SPA with basic components
	4.	Implement client-side routing for navigation
	5.	Manage component state using React Hooks
	6.	Integrate external APIs and handle data fetching
	7.	Deploy SPA to a hosting platform

⸻

Description

This experiment introduces React as a modern frontend framework and demonstrates how to build a Single Page Application (SPA). The application uses reusable components, manages state efficiently, and integrates external APIs for dynamic content.

The SPA architecture enables seamless navigation without page reloads, improving performance and user experience.
